# etr-biascorrect
Station-based Bias Correction of Gridded Weather for Agricultural Applications

THIS CODE IS IN DEVELOPMENT AND DOES NOT RUN

This code is still in early development, but eventually will support scripts to allow for calculation
of monthly bias correction factors that can be utilized to bias correct gridMET estimated ETr to weather station
observed data (ex. agriculture settings).
